0x00. Python - Hello, World
	this is my very first python project with ALX africa. it includes the following tasks;
task0: Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.
The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

task1: Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

task2: Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

task3: Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

task4: Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

task5: Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

task6: Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!

task7: Complete this source code
You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

task8: Complete this source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.
You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
You are not allowed to create new variables
You are not allowed to use string literals

task9: Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by TimPeters, followed by a new line.
Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py)

task10: Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
Requirements:

Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free
